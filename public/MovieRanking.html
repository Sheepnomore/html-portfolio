<hr />
<h3>'Celine and Julie Go Boating' Jacques Rivette</h3>
<p>This is the first movie that has ever touched upon my soul.</p>
<h3>'Nostalgia' Andrei Tarkovsky</h3>
<p>I love it for its topic addresses my keen interest of the "Motherland"</p>
<h3>'The Suspended Step of the Stork' Thodōros Angelopoulos</h3>
